	Form 137 and Student Promotion System of Manuel S. Rojas Elementary School
is designed to record all the grades and character grading of students for each school 
year including the summary of student promotion status. This system features different
processes that are connected to each other in order to meet the requirements of the
said system. 
	The users of the system particularly the administrators and teachers can access
the system through log in form which requires the username and password of each user. The
administrator will be responsible in setting the school year including the level and section
settings. This user will be the one to add and update the student and teacher's information.
When a grading period ends, administrator can set or check for the student promotion criteria
while teachers can input the student's grade and character grading. Printing of Form 137 and 
summary for student promotion can only be accessed by the administrator.
